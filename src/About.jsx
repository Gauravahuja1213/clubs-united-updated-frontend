      <h4>
        The development of a Student Chapter provides an opportunity to bring
        students from a university or college, interested faculty, and
        mechanical contractors together in a formalized group to learn more
        about career opportunities and the benefits that are available through
        the mechanical contracting industry. Student Chapters assist to further
        a studentâ€™s professional development.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Activities of the student chapter can include lunch discussions,
        community volunteer projects, lectures given by guest speakers, team
        projects such as competitions, social functions, and field trips to
        construction sites.
